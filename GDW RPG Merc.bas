'NPC MOTIVATIONS
'Much like PCs, NPCS also have motivations that lie behind everything that they do. In many cases,
'however, the motivations of NPCs are either obvious or unimportant. For example, general
'background characters, such as merchants or enemy soldiers, do not require a precise defnition
'of motivation. Motivation becomes necessary, however, with in?uential or potentially Important NPCs.
'Like PCs, their motivations are based on the standard deck of 'cards. If the Referee chooses to
'assign NPC motivations randomly, use the full deck and add both Joker cards. Otherwise,
'simply assign NPCs a motivation To determine NPC motivation, draw two cards from a standard
'deck of playing cards. The highest value card is the NPC's prime motivation, the other is his
'secondary motivation. The particular 'motive is determined by the suit of the card.
'Card values may be 'low (2, 3 or a 4), middle (5,6 or 7) or high (8,9 or 10). Aces and
'face cards have their own special meaning.

'Forward Observers
'On the battlefelds of the far future, immense and powerful weapons can be deployed against the enemy.
'However, whether they be missiles or bombs from fast-?ying aircraft, massive shells from artillery
'or apocalyptic energy blasts from orbiting spacecraft, they all still need eyes on the ground to
'be delivered accurately and effectively. This is where forward observers come in.

'A forward observer is anyone who has a direct line of sight to a target and a communications link
'to a weapon delivery 'system capable of attacking the target but otherwise unable to make the attack
'due to being beyond line of sight (for Artillery weapons), travelling too fast (aircraft) or simply
'being too far away to gain accurate visual sight (spacecraft in orbit).

'The forward observer makes an Electronics (comms) check (1D rounds, INT). Additional modifers may
'be included as if this Electronics (comms) check was an attack roll, including those for battlefeld
'conditions, cover, and any other factors the referee feels relevant.

'This check is then used as the start of a task chain, to be followed by a straight attack roll by
'the aircraft, artillery or orbiting spacecraft. The only modifers applied to this attack
'roll are from the task chain and the skill of the attacker using the weapon.

'If the attack roll misses the target, roll a dice for each point of negative Effect, then multiply
'the total by 10 if the attack was from aircraft or artillery and 100 if it were from a spacecraft.
'This is the number of metres the attack misses by. The referee can randomly determine in which
'direction the attack actually lands.

'Instruction: Individuals have extensive training In instructfng students in a clear and lucid manner and

'Players with Instructional expertise are capable of training recruits to carry out
'basic military functions. A player must have at least Instruction-1 to conduct any training at all. The more involved effects of training large bodies of men and the effects, of
'differing levels of instructional expertise are covered In the recruiting section of the book.

'In addition to general training functions, players with Instructional expertise may impart knowledge of
'certain well-understood skills to other players. Players may  impart skills to other players up to a
'level of one less than their instructional skill and one less than their own skill level in the skill being taught.
'Thus, a player with Instruction 4, Recon-5 and Demolitions-2 could teach another player Recon-3 and Demolitions-1.

'Each level of each skill taught requires six weeks of instruction during which the referee should severely curtail both players'
'activltles, or a SIX month course with other activities somewhat less curtailed. At the
'concluston of the course. the learnlng player must roll 9+ on two dice to achieve the skill.
'with a DM of +1 for Intel 8+ and 2 for lntel 10+.
'Players cannot teach the instructional skill to other players. Since the greatest asset an individual has is his pool of skills,
'the referee should exercise great caution In allowing players to hire nonplayer characters as Instructors.
